    <section id="paragraphs">
        <p>This page is a personal archive for my Alternate Universes (AUs) spanning several fandoms, including Harry Potter, A Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF), and others. It’s a space where I’ve gathered my ideas, stories, and concepts, capturing the evolution of these projects in various stages of development. Some AUs are nearly complete, with detailed storylines and character dynamics, while others are raw ideas that I might revisit and expand over time.</p>
        <p>Each AU represents my love for reimagining beloved worlds and exploring alternate paths for their characters. Here, I’ve played with pivotal moments, shifted genres, and crafted entirely new settings to see where these creative threads might lead. This archive serves as a personal journey through my imagination—a way to keep track of and reflect on the stories that have captured my interest.</p>
        <p>The AUs are organized by fandom, making it easier to revisit specific ideas or find inspiration when I need it. I’ve included notes, progress updates, and sometimes even snippets of text to remind myself of the direction each project might take. While this page isn’t intended to be shared, it’s a space where I can indulge in the joy of storytelling and worldbuilding.</p>
        <p>This archive is my creative retreat, a place where my ideas live and grow. It’s not about perfection but about capturing the spark of inspiration and giving it a space to flourish.</p>
